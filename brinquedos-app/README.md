This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Serverless Node.js Starter

A Serverless starter that adds ES7 syntax, serverless-offline, linting, environment variables, and unit test support. Part of the [Serverless Stack](http://serverless-stack.com) guide.

[Serverless Node.js Starter](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-nodejs-starter) uses the [serverless-bundle](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-bundle) plugin (an extension of the [serverless-webpack](https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack) plugin) and the [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline) plugin. It supports:

- **Generating optimized Lambda packages with Webpack**
- **Use ES7 syntax in your handler functions**
  - Use `import` and `export`
- **Run API Gateway locally**
  - Use `serverless offline start`
- **Support for unit tests**
  - Run `npm test` to run your tests
- **Sourcemaps for proper error messages**
  - Error message show the correct line numbers
  - Works in production with CloudWatch
- **Lint your code with ESLint**
- **Add environment variables for your stages**
- **No need to manage Webpack or Babel configs**

---

### Demo

A demo version of this service is hosted on AWS - [`https://z6pv80ao4l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello`](https://z6pv80ao4l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello)

And here is the ES7 source behind it

``` javascript
export const hello = async (event, context) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: `Go Serverless v1.0! ${(await message({ time: 1, copy: 'Your function executed successfully!'}))}`,
      input: event,
    }),
  };
};

const message = ({ time, ...rest }) => new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve(`${rest.copy} (with a delay)`);
  }, time * 1000)
);
```

### Upgrading from v1.x

We have detailed instructions on how to upgrade your app to the v2.0 of the starter if you were using v1.x before. [Read about it here](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-nodejs-starter/releases/tag/v2.0).

### Requirements

- [Install the Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)
- [Configure your AWS CLI](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/)

### Installation

To create a new Serverless project.

``` bash
$ serverless install --url https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-nodejs-starter --name my-project
```

Enter the new directory

``` bash
$ cd my-project
```

Install the Node.js packages

``` bash
$ npm install
```

### Usage

To run a function on your local

``` bash
$ serverless invoke local --function hello
```

To simulate API Gateway locally using [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline)

``` bash
$ serverless offline start
```

Deploy your project

``` bash
$ serverless deploy
```

Deploy a single function

``` bash
$ serverless deploy function --function hello
```

#### Running Tests

Run your tests using

``` bash
$ npm test
```

We use Jest to run our tests. You can read more about setting up your tests [here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html#content).

#### Environment Variables

To add environment variables to your project

1. Rename `env.example` to `.env`.
2. Add environment variables for your local stage to `.env`.
3. Uncomment `environment:` block in the `serverless.yml` and reference the environment variable as `${env:MY_ENV_VAR}`. Where `MY_ENV_VAR` is added to your `.env` file.
4. Make sure to not commit your `.env`.

#### Linting

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to lint your code via the [serverless-bundle](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-bundle) plugin.

You can turn this off by adding the following to your `serverless.yml`.

``` yaml
custom:
  bundle:
    linting: false
```

To [override the default config](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring), add a `.eslintrc.json` file. To ignore ESLint for specific files, add it to a `.eslintignore` file.

### Support

- Open a [new issue](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-nodejs-starter/issues/new) if you've found a bug or have some suggestions.
- Or submit a pull request!
